# TuneMate - Responsive Music-Themed Landing Page

TuneMate is a desktop-optimized, interactive landing page developed as part of the Web Development Internship at Prodigy InfoTech. This project is Task 01 (PRODIGY_WD_01) and demonstrates the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a visually rich and engaging user interface.

## Overview

TuneMate simulates a modern music streaming UI using front-end technologies. It features animated interactions, visual effects like glassmorphism, mood-based music categories, and dynamic content—all wrapped in a clean, dark-themed design. The site includes interactive elements such as a 3D rotating slider and a mini music player UI to demonstrate layout and styling skills.
